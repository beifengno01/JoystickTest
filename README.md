# JoystickTest
Control an Arduino-based robot with an Android app

# How does this work?
Right now, it doesn't. However, it will eventually connect to an Arduino via UDP and send packets that control a robot. The Arduino code will be up on my github eventually.

# Why did you write this code?
This was written for FRC Team 340. We're building a super cool robot that I'm not sure if I can talk about yet. More info to come.
